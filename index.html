        <p class = "about" id="leaguebody"><strong>Sport Shot League </strong><br> <br>One of our most popular activities that we run is our weekly sport shot league. In the league teams of 4 compete against each other on different collegiate sport 
          shot oil patterns to get the most points.
          Teams are drafted at the beginning of the semester by captains who had the highest averages from last sport shot 
          league. This is for bowlers that want some competition and want to test themselves on sport shot patterns. Sport shot patterns are more tricky oil patterns and 
          bowling on them is a good way to imporve your game. We highly recommend all skill levels of bowlers to join the sport shot league. The friendly competition and 
          excitement of the league makes this activity a blast! The league is $6 a week and it takes place on Mondays at 9pm. The sport shot 
          league requires some comitment, signups are at the beginning of the semester and members are required to make most of the league nights.
