          league teams of 3 to 4 compete for 3 games a week on different collegiate sport shot oil patterns.  Sport shot patterns are more tricky oil patterns, where your
          room for error is significantly decreased. <br> <br>
          Bowlers of all skill levels are welcome to challenge themselves, improve their game, and have fun. Bowling on them is a great way to improve your game. 
          Our league requires commitment. Members are required to make most of the league nights and pay for all the league weeks (even ones you don't attend).
